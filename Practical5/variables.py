3.1 some simple math
a = 19,245,301
b = 4,218,520	
c = 271
# give the value to the parameters
d = b - c 
e = a - b 
# calculate the dependent variables
if d < e:
  print(the rate of new	cases	was greater	in 2021)
else:
  print(the rate of new cases was greater in 2020)
# output to answer the question

3.2 Booleans
X = input("X =")
Y = input("Y =")
W = X and Y
print (W)
