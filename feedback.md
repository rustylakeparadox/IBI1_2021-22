  variable.py:
    Problem: codes don't run (no quotation marks for strings)
    Solution: add quotation marks for strings while using "print" function
    
  triangle.py:
    Problem: when doing loops, lack a vital step to drive the loop
    solution: add "n = n + 1" in the loop, so all the values in the range can be taken
    
  mystery_code.py:
    Problem: the answer for the usage of given codes isn't complete
    solution: add "only the last number is presented". 
              Next time I will check every step and I will be careful that every line of codes has its own usage.
   
  pizza_party.py:
    Problem: the teacher said the printout is hard to understand
    solution: I changed my word order and asked other students to check if it's easily-understood.
             
Practical 6: 
Problem: the two graphs lack labels
solution: I added "plt.xlabel()" and "plt.ylable()" to add labels to the graphs.
          Next time I will carefully read the instructions and see if I missed anything.
